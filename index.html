                        <h2 >Background</h2>
                             <p>I was born and raised in Meru County North Imenti. For my primary school i joined Lions Nursery and Primary School and after completion i joined Nkubu High school in South Imenti. After KCSE, I qualified to join Strathmore University to Pursue a Bachelors degree in Busines Information Technology. I have worked in different
                                companies in Kenya which include Karirana Estates Limited otherwise known as Eden Tea for my Internship. I also worked at Red Cross as a volunteer
                          </p>

                     <p>I made the decision to take a class on programming for skill and carrer development. The tech space being a very dynamic field i believe equipping oneself with coding skills is vital.
